# crime-moses
#GUTSHackathon2016

Created as part of the Glasgow University Tech Society Hackathon 2016 SAS challenge.

This project utilises Google BigQuery's API for PHP to generate simple outputs on a webpage about crime data in Chicago.

You will need to configure a new Google Cloud Platform project and add the BigQuery API, as well as a service user for the API. The JSON file with the service user's credentials should replace `vendor/service_user_credentials.json`.
